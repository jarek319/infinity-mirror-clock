An interesting visualization using the Infinity Mirror effect with a ring of RGB LEDs

I was playing with two-way acrylic and held it over a few Neopixels I had on hand, and found a really cool Infinity Mirror effect occuring when I angled the acrylic just right. Thinking about a good application for this, I decided to use to the effect to create "hands" for an analog-styled clock made of LEDs.
